Hey bro, hear me out
get off the internet, please.
You know you wanna.

It's always the same,
open an app, scroll a bit.
Every, single, day.

How much of all this
is propaganda, ya think?
I'd bet its a lot.

It's watching you too.
Every little click or tap
is recorded, tracked.

And what do you get?
Nothing. Anger, sadness, guilt.
It's all so tiring.

Leave your phone at home.
Straight up, for real, go touch grass.
Smile at a human.

Participation
in the world will fill you more.
Own yourself again.
